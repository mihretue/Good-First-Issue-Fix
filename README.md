Weather-Based Greeting Project üéâ
About the Project

This Python project greets users based on the time of day and displays the current weather in their city (if available). It‚Äôs designed to be interactive, multilingual, and resilient to API rate limits.

Goal

Demonstrate how to integrate weather APIs and geolocation in Python

Handle errors gracefully (rate limits, invalid API keys)

Provide a personalized greeting experience

Technology Stack

Python

requests for HTTP requests

pytz for timezone handling

Weather API (OpenWeatherMap
)

IP Geolocation API (ipapi.co
 or fallback)

Features

Greets users based on the current time (morning, afternoon, evening)

Supports multiple languages: English, Hindi, Greek, Italian

Automatically detects user location using IP (with fallback if API fails)

Displays weather information (temperature and description) for the detected city

Handles invalid timezones and languages gracefully

Fix for Good-First-Issue üéØ

Previously, the program could not fetch the user‚Äôs city and country due to a small bug in the get_location() function.

Fixes applied:

Corrected request.get() ‚Üí requests.get()

Used .get() to safely access API data

Added fallback defaults if IP API fails or is rate-limited

def get_location():
    """Fetch user's location using IP API with fallback."""
    try:
        response = requests.get("https://ipapi.co/json")
        data = response.json()
        if data.get("error"):
            return "Addis Ababa", "Ethiopia"
        return data.get("city", "Addis Ababa"), data.get("country_name", "Ethiopia")
    except Exception:
        return "Addis Ababa", "Ethiopia"

Before & After
Before
Good evening, Mihretu Endeshaw!
greeting! (Location not found)

After
Good evening, Mihretu Endeshaw! üåç
The weather in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia is 25¬∞C, Clear sky


Works even if the IP API is rate-limited

Provides default city/country
