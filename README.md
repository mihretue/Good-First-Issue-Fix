# Weather-Based Greeting Project

## About the Project
This Python project enhances user interaction by not only greeting users based on the time of day but also displaying the current weather conditions for their location. This makes the experience more personalized and dynamic.

## Goal
To demonstrate how to integrate a weather API in Python to fetch and display real-time weather information based on the user's location.

## Technology Stack
- Python
- `requests` module
- Weather API (e.g., [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/))

## Features
- Greets users based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night).  
- Fetches and displays the current weather in the user's location using a weather API.  
- Shows temperature, weather description, and optionally other details like humidity and wind speed.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-greeting.git
